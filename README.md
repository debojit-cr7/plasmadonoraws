# PlasmaDonorAWS
In this project we mainly focus on the available plasma donor count, with their details during this pandemic situation.
Here the app is codded through Python as well as the framework. The Lambda fucntions are also coded with Python.
I will store the data of the plasma donors with all details in a DynamoDB table.
Then I have created API gateways to invoke the lambda fuction to operate properly and feed us with correct details.
